								WACM will hold the WACM Explains: Basic Linux next week on September 11th (Tuesday) 6:45 pm - 8:15 pm in CS 1240. There will be two identical sessions; this is the first of the two sessions. <br><br>

								WACM has traditionally helped all CS students to be more prepared for their introductory CS courses by holding this workshop that teaches some of the basic Linux commands. This workshop is open to all students. The goal is to build practical familiarity with the Linux environment and use the university machines to create and test assignments. Here's what WACM has taught in previous semesters: <a href="http://research.cs.wisc.edu/wacm/docs/WACMExplains-IntroToLinux.pdf"/>handout</a> <br><br>

								Many CS students specially enrolled in 300-500 level courses typically find it useful to have someone walk them through the similar commands.<br><br>

								P.S.: For the students “Bringing your laptop and trying the Linux commands during the event would be very helpful.”<br><br>

								Join us in CS 1240 on Tuesday, September 11.

								<br><br>This talk is designed to help undergraduate female computer science majors imagine a career in Computer Sciences and Information Technology. Listen to a panel of experts - real Madison women who are working in technology - tell their personal stories.
								<br><br>You will learn: Why did they enter the their field? What do they like and dislike about it? How did they get to where they are now?
								<br><br>Share your ideas and ask questions, such as: How did your education prepare you for your career? What do you wish you had known when you were still in school? Did you have any mentors or others along the way that helped you at critical moments? How do you balance family life with career?
