<h3>Wisconsin Science Festival -- Programming for Science, Games, and Art</h3>
<h4>Saturday, September 28th from 9am - 5pm in CS&amp;S 1370</h4>

<p>We use computers all the time.  We use them to solve problems, entertain ourselves, and even create art!  Have you ever wondered how to <em>program</em> -- that is, how to tell the computer what to do?  In our drop-in session, we will guide you through some projects using <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/">Scratch</a>, a drag-and-drop programming language from MIT.  We will have guides for doing three projects:
<ul>
<li><b>Science/Math</b>: Computers are known for being good at solving math problems quickly, which makes them valuable to scientists!  In this tutorial, we will investigate the Fibonacci sequence.</li>
<li><b>Art</b>: We can easily make animations in Scratch.  Learn how to make a short movie.</li>
<li><b>Games</b>: You can use Scratch to make arcade games or guessing games.  Maybe you will make the next Angry Birds?</li>
</ul>

Each of these guides will just get you started -- then you can explore on your own and come up with your own ideas! You can also use Scratch at home, for free!</p>

<p><a href="basics.html">Let's get started!</a></p>
<p>If you already have some Scratch background, you can do directly to the projects:
<ul>
<li><a href="fib1.html"><strong>Science/Math</strong>: The Fibonacci Sequence, a really cool series of numbers that appears everywhere in nature</a></li>
<li><a href="anim1.html"><strong>Art</strong>: Animations are fun to make in Scratch.  You can use them to make art or tell stories.</a></li>
<li><a href="game1.html"><strong>Entertainment</strong>: A game where you try to click on moving objects for points</a></li>
</ul>
</p>
