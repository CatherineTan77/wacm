<h3>Entertainment: Games</h3>

<p>Scratch can be used to make many different kinds of games: arcade games, guessing games, adventure games -- if you can imagine it, you can probably make it.</p>
<p>Games are very interactive: when the user does something, we want to react based on what they did!  So, we will need to use another type of <span class="control">control</span> block.  We also will want to keep track of the score, which will use a <span class="variable">variable</span>.  Variables are things you can use to store a value.  For instance, you could set a variable called "points" to 0, and then every time the user did something, you could make "points" go up.</p>

<p><strong>Your task</strong>: Make a <span class="variable">variable</span> called points.  Then, look in the <span class="control">control</span> tab for a way to make an action happen when the user clicks on the actor.  When that happens, you want to give the user one point.  Can you figure out how to do this?</p>
