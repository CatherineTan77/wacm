<h3>The Basics Part 2</h3>

<p>Did you make a Script?  Here is an example of one I made.  Of course, there are unlimited possibilities so yours is probably not identical to mine!</p>
<div><img src="motion.png" alt="example motion script" /></div>
<p>If you want the Actor to repeat the motion, you can keep clicking on it.  But that's kind of boring.  Let's look at some <span class="control">Control</span> instructions and see how to do something more interesting.  Click on the <span class="control">Control</span> tab on the left bar and look at the instructions you can choose from, then add to your previous script.</p>
<p><strong>Task 2</strong>: Find a way using a <span class="Control">control</span> block to make the Actor do your actions as many times as how many years old you are.  For a bonus challenge, can you make the Actor start following the Script when you click on the green flag on the upper right corner of the stage?</p>
<p>When you finish, go to the next page.</p>
