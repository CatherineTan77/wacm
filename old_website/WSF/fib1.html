<h3>The Fibonacci Sequence 1</h3>

<p>The Fibonacci sequence is found all over in nature, from pinecones to sunflowers to seashells. The first few numbers are:</p>
<p><strong>1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34...</strong></p>
<p>Can you spot the pattern?  Try looking at the difference between each number and the one after it.</p>


<p><strong>Question 1</strong>: What number comes next?  How about the one after that?  You can use a calculator or pencil and paper if you want.</p>
