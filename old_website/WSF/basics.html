<h3>The Basics</h3>

<p>How does a computer know what to do?  We have to tell it in a language it can understand.  These languages are called <em>programming languages</em> and we will be using one called Scratch.  When we look at the Scratch programming environment, we see something like this:
</p>
<div><img src="scratch.png" alt="Scratch environment" /></div>
<p>On the right side, you can see a white box with a cat in it.  We call this the <em>Stage</em>, and the cat is an <em>Actor</em> (sometimes called a <em>Sprite</em>).  Have you ever been in a play?  How do the actors know what to do?  They read from something called a <em>Script</em>, which tells them what to say and do.  Scratch works the same way: we can drag blocks from the left pane into the the middle (where it says "Scripts"), and then when we double-click on the instruction, the Actor will follow it.  The different instructions fit together like puzzle pieces to make sets of instructions, like a scene in a play.</p>

<p><strong>Task 1</strong>: Can you drag a block into the Script pane and double-click it to make the cat move?  Try choosing one of the instructions in the blue <span class="motion">Motion</span> tab.  How about dragging more than one <span class="motion">Motion</span> block and sticking them together?  What happens if you change the number in the white box?</p>
<p>If you get stuck or confused at any point, feel free to ask any of the volunteers questions!</p>
