<h3>Art: Spirographs</h3>

<p>There are many types of art we can make in Scratch.  For example, we can have multiple actors each performing actions or saying lines, to act out a story.  Another way we can make art is to use the <span class="pen">pen</span> tool, which is what this guide will show you.</p>

<p>The pen tool is used to make a line where one of the actors is moving.  The line will start when you use the pen down instruction (just like when you put pen to paper), and stop when you use the pen up instruction (like lifting your pen from the paper).  You can use the clear instruction, also under the <span class="pen">pen</span> tab, to remove all the lines.</p>

<p><strong>Your task</strong>: Use the pen to draw a line behind your actor as it moves.  You can make it move using whichever instructions you want.  Remember, to make the actor move, you should use blocks from the <span class="motion">motion</span> tab.</p>
