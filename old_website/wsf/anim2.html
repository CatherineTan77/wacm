<h3>Art: Spirographs 2</h3>

<p>Here is my script, but yours probably looks a little different:</p>

<p>One cool thing we can do is to make different shapes behind our actor.  A way to do this is to have the actor take a certain number of steps, turn some number of degrees, and then repeat that over and over.</p>

<p><strong>Your task</strong>: Use the <span class="pen">pen</span>, a <span class="control">forever</span> block, and two <span class="motion">motion</span> blocks: move _ steps and turn _ degrees to make some shapes.  Some numbers to use for degrees are: 144 to have a 5 pointed star, or 135 to have an 8 pointed star.  Hint: if the actor is too big and blocking your view, you can shrink it!  Look above the stage for a row of icons: stamp, scissors, grow, and shrink.  If you click the shrink icon and then on the actor, you can make it smaller!</p>
